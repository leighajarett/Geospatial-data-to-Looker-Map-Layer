# Geospatial-data-to-Looker-Map-Layer

Python Notebook that steps through a process for creating a geojson file, from lat/long coordinate data that maps to polygons.
The script maps each polygon to its corresponding ID so that the converted topojson file can be used as a map_layer, tied to the proper ID dimension, in Looker.
